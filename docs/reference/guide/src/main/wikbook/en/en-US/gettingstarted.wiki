This chapter introduces you to the basic of Chromattic and the Java Content Repository to object mapping. We will show
the most basic Chromattic application and focus on the various steps to build this application.

= The website example =

The project example models a web site persisted in a JCR server. The site contains web pages that are organized
according to a tree structure making easy to display the pages on the web. The natural JCR hierarchy tree shape
will model the hierarchy of the pages.

== The Page object ==

The ##org.chromattic.docs.reference.gettingstarted.Page## class is the object representation of a web page.
The ##Page## object is mapped to the JCR //page// node type. The ##Page## class contains
the properties we want for the representation of a web page:

* The property ##name## is the web page name and is mapped to the JCR node name.
* The property ##title## is the page title and is mapped to the JCR //title// node property of type ##STRING##.
* The property ##content## is the page content and is mapped to the JCR //content// node property of type ##STRING##.

{{important}}The Javabean properties needs to be modelled as abstract methods because it allows Chromattic to implement them to make
the mapping between objects and node possible.{{/important}}

{{anchor id=getting_started_page_object/}}
{{example title="The Page class"}}
{{java}}
{@javadoc org.chromattic.docs.reference.gettingstarted.Page}
{@include org.chromattic.docs.reference.gettingstarted.Page}
{{/java}}
{{/example}}

Chromattic uses code annotations to declare which and how classes are mapped to node types. The most important annotation
is the ##@org.chromattic.api.annotations.PrimaryType## that declares the mapping of a class to a
node type. Our class is annotated with the ##@PrimaryType## annotation, the ##name## parameter
specifies the name of the node type mapped to the class.

{{note}}JCR defines two kinds of node types which are primary node type and mixin node type. By default we
denote by node type a primary node type. Mixin node type can also be mapped by Chromattic that is explained in
the chapter XYZ.{{/note}}

The ##@org.chromattic.api.annotations.Name## annotation targets Javabean property getters or setters and
indicates that the property is mapped to the name of the node. Indeed each JCR node has a mandatory name and this is the
way to expose it on a class. As a result the ##Page## //name// property is mapped to the node name.

Like the ##@Name## annotation the ##@org.chromattic.api.annotations.Property## annotation
targets Javabean properties. It specifies how a property is mapped to a node property. It has a mandatory
##name## parameter that specifies the node property name. The node property type does not need to be
specified as it is deduced from the class property. In our example, we map the //content// Javabean property to
a //content// node property.

== The JCR node types ==

Node types are important for JCR, they define the schema of the node data. In our application we have a ##page##
  node type that is modelled after the ##Page## class. Chromattic can generate for you the node type definition
  when the classes are compiled. It results in a ##nodetype.xml## file resources located in the class output of
  the Java^^tm^^ compiler.

The annotation ##org.chromattic.api.annotations.NodeTypeDefs## instructs the compiler to generate the the
node type definitions in the XML format that can be used by the JCR server to create the node type. The annotation
targets a package and it generate the node type for any Chromattic class inside this package and in the sub packages.

{{example title="The org.chromattic.docs.reference.gettingstarted.package-info.java file package"}}
{{java}}
@NodeTypeDefs package org.chromattic.docs.reference.gettingstarted;

import org.chromattic.api.annotations.NodeTypeDefs;
{{/example}}

{{warning}}The node type generation is still a work in progress and should be considered as an experimental feature{{/warning}}

== The client ==

We have designed and mapped our ##Page## object and now we will examine how to interact with a JCR server
via Chromattic. The goal of the client is very simple and focus on demonstrating the bootstrap of Chromattic and the
persistence of a simple ##Page## in the Java Content Repository.

=== Chromattic bootstrap ===

The boostrap is the creation and the configuration of the Chromattic runtime. Usually the bootstrap occurs during the
initialization of the application, for instance in a web application, it is most often performed in a
##ServletContextListener## initialization.

Chromattic bootstrap relies mainly on the ##ChromatticBuilder## object. The builder
is configured with the Chromattic application classes to obtain an instance of the ##Chromattic## object. The
##Chromattic## object can be used to create ##ChromatticSession## objects. The
##ChromatticSession## is the main runtime API used to interract with Chromattic.

{{java}}
{@include org.chromattic.docs.reference.gettingstarted.GettingStartedTestCase#testClient() {1}}
{{/java}}

=== Interacting with Chromattic objects ===

We have just explained how to obtain a ##Chromattic## object thanks to the builder.
Now it is time to show how to obtain and use the ##ChromatticSession## with the goal to insert a
new page node. Let's examine the code:

{{java}}
{@include org.chromattic.docs.reference.gettingstarted.GettingStartedTestCase#testClient() {2}}
{{/java}}

== Project build ==

The project build is an important piece of the software infrastructure and Chromattic has been developped to integrate
seamlessly with the build.

Chromattic leverages the [[Java^^tm^^ 6 Annotation Processor Tool>>http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/apt/index.html]]
(abbreviated as APT) that works at the Java^^tm^^compiler level and therefore there is nothing much to do to integrate
Chromattic in the build itself.

As many Object Relational Mapping tool, Chromattic needs a bit of instrumentation to make the magic work.
Chromattic does not modify existing classes, it takes the existing classes and adds new classes and that is achieved thanks
to the APT plugin. It means that instrumentation is performed at the compilation time by generating Java^^tm^^source file
that are compiled by the compiler instead of generating those classes at the load time in the virtual machine.

The only condition to enable Chromattic instrumentation is to have the Chromattic APT jar on the compilation classpath.
Nothing more, nothing less.

=== Building with Maven ===

Building with Maven is very easy and only requires a dependency on the Chromattic API and APT module in your pom file.

* The API dependency provides the Chromattic API classes prefixed with the ##org.chromattic.api## package. (((
{{code language=XML}}<dependency>
  <groupId>org.chromattic</groupId>
  <artifactId>chromattic.api</artifactId>
</dependency>{{/code}})))
* The APT dependency triggers the Chromattic instrumentation. (((
{{code language=XML}}<dependency>
  <groupId>org.chromattic</groupId>
  <artifactId>chromattic.apt</artifactId>
</dependency>{{/code}})))

And that's it, we have just configured our project. 

== Running the client ==

The client requires different jars for running

todo : provide an uber client jar
